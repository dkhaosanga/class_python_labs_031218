##this is to pass errors (specific things and multiple things), explicitly scilencing:
#try:
#   print(phonebook['dover'])
#except KeyError:
#   print('There is no key by that value')
#finally: #will always excute, even if there was already a KeyError or ValueError

##combining two dictionaries together (starting methods...)
# phonebook2 =  {'dover': {'first_name': 'Sheri', 'last_name': 'Dover', 'phone': '5030989073'}}
#
# phonebook.update(phonebook2) #concatenating two dictionaries together
#print(phonebook.keys) prints all the keys, .values() = values, .items().  to print these out as a list do print(list(phonebook.keys()))

##checking to see if the key is there
# phonebook = {'key': 'value1', 'key1': 'value2'}
#
# new = phonebook.get('key5' , "no key") #change 'key into something else and it won't print out value1, instead "no key will print out"
# print(new)
